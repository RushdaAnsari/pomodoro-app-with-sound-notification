# pomodoro-app-with-sound-notification
This is a simple Pomodoro Timer App built using Python's Tkinter module that helps you manage your work sessions and breaks.The app features three tabs - Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break, each with a pre-defined timer.

When the timer for a particular session ends, the app plays a sound notification. You can also skip or reset the timer.

# Usage
To use the app, simply select one of the three tabs: Pomodoro, Short Break, or Long Break. Each tab corresponds to a different timer interval. The Pomodoro timer is set to 25 minutes, the Short Break timer is set to 5 minutes, and the Long Break timer is set to 15 minutes.

Once you have selected a tab, click the "Start" button to start the timer. The timer will display the remaining time in minutes and seconds. You can also click the "Skip" button to skip the current interval and move on to the next one. Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer to its initial value.

When the timer goes off, a sound will play to alert you that the interval is over. The app also keeps track of the number of Pomodoros completed. Each time you complete a Pomodoro interval, the counter will increase by one.
